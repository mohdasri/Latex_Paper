% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***

% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference, compsoc]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{\textbf{Introduction}}
% no \IEEEPARstart

% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
Peer-to-peer systems, beginning with Napster, Gnutella, and several other related systems,became immensely popular in the past few years, primarily because they offered a way for people to get music without paying for it. However, under the hood, these systems represent a paradigm shift from the usual web client/server model, where there are no “servers;” every system acts as a peer, and by virtue of the huge number of peers,
objects can be widely replicated, providing the opportunity for high availability and scalability, despite the lack of centralized infrastructure. Peer-to-peer systems (P2P) have grown in importance over the last 5 years as an attractive way to mobilize the resources of Internet users. As more and more users have powerful processors, large storage spaces and fast network connections, more actors seek to coordinate these resources for common goals. Because of their unique decentralized nature, security in these systems is both critical and an interesting problem. Good security on P2P systems must reflect the design goals of the system itself. The introduction of some basic concepts for P2P systems and their security demands, and then discuss several case studies to highlight issues of robustness, privacy, and trust. An analysis of the systems that offer secure distributed routing, privacy-enhancing and censorship-resistance publishing, shared storage and decentralized collaborative work spaces. The conclusions are about an accountability and trust mechanisms must be built into a secure system. 


\section{ Peer-To-Peer Systems }

Peer-to-peer systems have two dominant features that distinguish them from a more standard client-server model of information distribution: they are overlay networks that have unique namespaces. P2P systems link different, possibly heterogeneous systems as ‘peers,’ and allow them to interact on top of existing network configurations. It does this by defining relationships unique to that system, usually in the form of a topology by which systems are linked. Occasionally a system will piggyback atop an existing namespace, such as the IP/port labeling, but still treats these separately from the Internet-layer protocols. The combined effect of independent systems interacting through a unique namespace is decentralization. Not every system generally considered a P2P system is strictly decentralized in management—the infamous Napster actually ran through a centralized server—but the matter of decentralization brings out important concerns for system security. 
Although they have won the most attention for their roles as (often illicit) file-swapping networks, peer-to-peer systems can serve many functions, and design considerations must reflect these. One proposed use of a P2P system was that of shared expertise. A Gnutella pioneer has suggested that the system could be used to propagate queries of any sort through a network until a peer felt that it could respond to the query, anything from a lexical look-up to a specialized calculation (Kan, 2000). In a network with varied resource availability, P2P systems have been used to distribute those resources to those who need or want them the most. The shared resources in question are usually computation or storage. This can create efficient resource usage, 
given a low marginal cost of using a resource not otherwise needed. Beyond sharing computation power for enormous tasks, P2P networks have been proposed as an escrow system for digital rights management, or for distributing searches across a wide range of other peers. A new class of business software systems known as ‘groupware’ uses many P2P principles. Groupware networks are closed networks that support collaborative work, such as the Groove network discussed below. Finally, the decentralized nature of peer systems offers many positive features for publishing and distribution systems, not least of which is their resilience to legal and physical attacks and censorship. P2P architectures have many different functions, and different functions lead to different design conclusions, with respect to overall system structure, and specifically to security issues.


\section {P2P And Security }

Security expert Bruce Schneier is often quoted as claiming that “Security is a process.” As such, it matters very much whether security administration is centralized or decentralized. The basic model of the commercial Internet is the client-server relationship. As the network user base grew, less and less responsibility for administration was placed on the edges of the network, and more was concentrated in smart ‘servers.’ This model is most evident on the World Wide Web, but file servers, mail servers and centralized security administration mechanisms such as Virtual Private Networks have all grown apace. In a centralized system, security policy can be dictated from a single location, and a ‘that which is not permitted is forbidden’ policy can be enforced with firewalls, monitoring and intervention.
On the other hand, centralization offers a single point of failure. Both direct malicious attacks and lax or negligent administration at the heart of a centralized network can undermine security for an entire system. With a single breach, outgoing or incoming content can be corrupted or intercepted, or the system can be rendered inoperable with a denial of service attack. Critical infrastructure systems such as the Domain Name System (DNS) have redundant implementation exactly because a single point of control is vulnerability in and of itself. In a decentralized P2P system, bad behavior has a locality impediment. Malicious attacks need to occur at or near every part of the system it wishes to affect.
P2P systems lack the tools available to a centralized administrator, so it can be much more difficult to implement security protections on a deployed P2P system. Moreover, the absence of a defensible border of a system means that it is hard to know friend from foe. Malicious users can actively play the role of insiders—i.e., they can run peers themselves, and often a great number of them. Doceur (2002) notes that this is incredibly hard for any open system to defend itself against this sort of
attack, known as a Sybil attack (named after a famous Multiple-Personality Disorder case study). Several solutions are discussed below. As such, many systems are designed with strong security considerations in mind, depending on their function, from cover traffic to prevent monitoring of file transfer to a reputation system that can discourage single actors from controlling too many trusted nodes. As above, the wide range of security issues makes optimizing for all not a feasible option. This will become evident in our discussions of actual P2P systems below, but first we present some of the more common security demands.
One way to think about P2P is whether it applies at the network level, the application level or the user level. At the network level, an adversary may try to break the routing system, or block access to information by impeding queries, or partitioning the network. At the application level, an adversary can attempt to corrupt or delete data stored in the system or in transit. Finally, the users themselves can be the subject of attack if an adversary goes after anonymity and privacy protections.
Camp (2003) offers an operational definition of trust based on the risk that a system will fail to perform as specified. This is a broader view of security, but one that suits our purposes. In a P2P system, we are interested in not only how one aspect of the system behavior withstands attack, but how the entire system is defended. Since policy is not set dynamically, but is the sum of all behavior in the network, security also includes the expected behavior of other peers, and what their incentives are. Layers of protection interact. These levels translate into more specific security goals for system to operate reliably.
In the examples that follow, we highlight security features of these systems, and the design choices made to offer optimal security for a given task. Discussions of cryptanalysis and other field-specific security issues employed by P2P systems are outside the scope of this chapter, as are more complete descriptions of these systems and their performance. Instead, these descriptions are intended to illustrate security mechanisms rather than fully describe all nuances of any P2P system.
The case studies below highlight some of these goals. Secure distributed transport mechanisms like Tarzan ensure that the identity of the user and the content of the message remain a secret while secure overlay mechanisms are designed to ensure that the message gets through and gets there efficiently. Freenet and Free Haven ensure adequate file maintenance, so that users can reliably access any file they want, or any file that have been published, respectively. Groove allows networks of peers to manage themselves. Distributed storage mechanisms can create conditions for cooperative behavior and coordinated dependencies. Finally, we discuss accountability devices protect against free riding and nodes that are known to misbehave.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
